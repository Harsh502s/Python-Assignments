It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\n","doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\n","the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\n","analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\n","its way toward this goal.\n","\n","Main Features\n","-------------\n","Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n","\n","  - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating\n","    point data.\n","  - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and\n","    higher dimensional objects\n","  - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned\n","    to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let\n","    `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n","    computations.\n","  - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\n","    operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.\n","  - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\n","    and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.\n","  - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large\n","    data sets.\n","  - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\n","  - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n","  - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick).\n","  - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),\n","    Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\n","    format.\n","  - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency\n","    conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging."]}],"source":["import numpy as
